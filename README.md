# YouAintCool
The long awaited sequel to YouAintSpecial.

## What does it do?
YouAintCool hides VIP chat prefixes, VIP profile badges, Boosts messages, and if you really insist (and I don't know why)
you can hide the messages of anyone who has VIP rank. Each feature is configurable with /youaintcool

## How?
Simple!
